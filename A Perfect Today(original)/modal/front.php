				Front end development is mostly focused on what some may coin the "client side" of development. Front end developers will be engaged in analyzing code, design, and debugging applications along with ensuring a seamless user experience. You manage what people first see in their browser. As a front end developer you are responsible for the look, feel and ultimately design of the site.</p>

				<p>A front end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page. They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming to code a website’s appearance, as well as taking care of debugging. Whenever you visit a website, anything that you see, click on or otherwise use is the work of a front end developer.<br><br></p>

				</div>
				<p>Front end developers use HTML to lay out a document’s general structure and content, CSS for styling and JavaScript for situations that require advanced interactivity. Additionally, they might use AJAX (a combination of JavaScript and XML) to update specific areas of a website without having to refresh the entire page.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Libraries and Frameworks</strong></p>
				<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
				  	<img class=" img-border pic" src="web/front/6.png" alt="">	
				</div>
				<p>Front end developers also commonly use the libraries built on these programming languages like AngularJS, jQuery and React; and design frameworks including Foundation and Bootstrap. CSS extensions, such as SASS, provide improved modularity and power.</p>

				</div>
				<p>While they are less common, front end developers may also use Python, Ruby or PHP to easily connect data with the back end of their website.</p>

			  		<img class=" img-border pic" src="web/front/14.jpg" alt="">	
				</div>
				<p>Most front end developers use CSS preprocessors to add functionality to CSS coding, making it more scalable and easier to interact with. Prior to publishing the code on your website, CSS preprocessors transition it into well-formatted CSS that works across a variety of browsers, the most in-demand being LESS and SASS. </p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Using APIs and RESTful Services</strong></p>
				<p>A front end developer will also interact with and make use of APIs and RESTful services. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a lightweight architecture that makes network communications simpler, while APIs and RESTful services follow that architecture. </p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Creating Maintaining Mobile and Responsive Design</strong></p>
				<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
			  		<img class=" img-border pic" src="web/front/2.png" alt="">	
				</div>
				<p>With the rise of people using mobile devices to connect to the internet, it has become essential for websites to be mobile-friendly. As such, most front end developers now create responsive designs or mobile designs for their websites. <br>
				Responsive design changes a website’s layout depending on the device and screen size, and occasionally requiring changes to the content and functionality based on those factors.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Developing Across Browsers</strong></p>
				<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
			  		<img class=" img-border pic" src="web/front/13.jpg" alt="">	
				</div>
				<p>If your web development isn’t functional across the full range of browsers that are available today, you will miss out on an entire category of potential web users. While browsers are fairly consistent, their differences can be significant, including in terms of coding interpretation. A front end web developer must understand these differences and incorporate them into their code.  </p>
