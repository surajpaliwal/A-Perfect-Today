				<p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we order and the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and implement Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.<br><br>

				Not only is the web development field exciting and on the forefront of the digital age, but it’s also a growing field. This guide will explain how to become a web developer, what skills and education are needed, different career paths, current market trends, and what people can expect as a web developer professional.</p>

						<p class="center"><strong >WEB DEVELOPMENT BASICS</strong></p>
						<p>Web developers are responsible for designing and developing websites and website applications. Using a variety of programming languages and web technologies, web developers manage site functionality, implement application features, and integrate security measures.</p>
						<p class="center"><strong >WEB DEVELOPMENT IN-DEPTH</strong></p>
											
						<p>Web developers have expertise in object-oriented programming, multiplatform development, and the building of web applications. They blend creative vision with project management skills to plan, design and build websites and integrated applications. Because of the complex nature of websites, developers traditionally specialize in one of two tracks: front-end or back-end development.<br><br></p>

				<p>Web development is a flexible professional field, one that affords prospective students multiple ways to gain the training and experience necessary to begin their careers. Below is an overview of steps interested individuals can take to enter this career field.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >1-CHOOSE A DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIZATION</strong></p>

					<div class="col-lg-6 text-left">						
						<p>Each element of a website is linked to something else, and it’s a complex job to build a website successfully. Depending on their specific jobs, web developers will be proficient in using various software programs (e.g. JavaScript frameworks, version control, CSS), and will have not only the specialized knowledge that characterizes their roles, but also an understanding of the process as a whole. <br>Prior to starting out, it’s wise to get an understanding of the type of web development work that seems interesting—such as user interface design, mobile application development, or front-end development—to best set the stage for future education and training.</p>

					 	<p>No specific degree or educational path exists for careers in web development, and it’s possible to become a web developer with or without a formal education. While it’s certainly possible to learn coding languages independently, there is more to web development than coding. Individuals who can implement coding skills within a broader context may have an advantage, and that’s where a formal education can help prospective developers gain foundational knowledge of web development principles and practices, expose them to project management and situations that require problem-solving, and encourage critical thinking.<br>

					  	<p>Despite the real advantages that come with an organized education, web development is still a field in which concrete skills can trump education when it comes to employment opportunities. Companies want employees who can produce, and how or where something was learned is secondary to simply being able to do it. Prospective web developers should have expertise in the three core programming components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They should also learn about CSS and CSS frameworks such as Backbone, Bootstrap, and Foundation. Finally, to build applications, developers should be proficient in back-end languages such as Ruby, Java, PHP and tools such as Oracle and SQL Server.</p>

An active Github profile can get the attention of employers searching through stacks of resumes, and demonstrates not only what a candidate does to solve programming issues, but also the thinking and strategies behind those solutions. Practicing coding and getting used to using Git prepares developers to work as part of a team, as well as manage complicated site and application builds.</p>

				Central to the success of a web developer are strong technical coding skills, and how to implement them within the context of Internet conventions and web applications. Beyond technical expertise, web developers must also have the right blend of soft skills in the workplace, including the ability to communicate clearly as well as a mindset geared to analytical problem-solving. Below is a list of common technical skills and competency areas that are important in web development.</p>
						
				<p class="center"><strong >HTML</strong></p>
				<p>Not a programming language, but the foundational element of any website. Includes the core elements of how a page should look.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></p>
				<p>CSS manages the way a page looks and serves as the guiding style instructions for a website—from fonts to color.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >CSS Frameworks</strong></p>
				<p>CSS frameworks are used to structure and develop websites. They provide custom style guides that are used to help developers maintain industry best practices. Examples include Bootstrap and Foundation.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >JavaScript</strong></p>
				<p>A programming language that controls how websites and dynamic web applications operate.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Responsive Web Design</strong></p>
				<p>Modern websites must adapt to mobile device use, requiring an understanding of responsive web design.</p>
						
				<p class="center"><strong >Version Control</strong></p>
				<p>When building a site, developers must manage the progress of their projects. Version control software, such as Git, allows developers to maintain and track changes to their code.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Browser Development Tools</strong></p>
				<p>Web developers need to understand how pages are rendered in a browser in order to identify bugs and improve performance.</p>

				<p class="center"><strong >Testing</strong></p>
				<p>When coding, bugs will be introduced into the system. Web developers should have familiarity with testing processes used to identify those bugs, and software frameworks such as Jasmine.</p>
				</p>
				
				<p class="center"><strong >Programming Languages</strong></p>
				<p>Depending on their professional specialty, web developers should be proficient in programming languages and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Python,java or PHP.</p>
