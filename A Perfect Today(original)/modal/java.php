				<p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.<br><br>
				Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.<br><br>
				Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.<br>

		  		<p>
		  		There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
				<div class="row">
				  	<div class="col-md-6 text-left">
					  	<ol sytle="list-style-type:1;">
							<li><strong> Standalone Application</strong> − Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.</li>

							<li><strong>Web Application</strong> −An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.</li>

							<li><strong>Enterprise Application</strong> − An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.</li>

							<li><strong> Mobile Application</strong> − An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.</li>

					  	<ol sytle="list-style-type:1;">
							<li><strong> Java SE (Java Standard Edition)</strong> − It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</li>

							<li><strong>Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)</strong> −It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on the top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.</li>

							<li><strong> Java ME (Java Micro Edition)</strong> − It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.</li>

							<li><strong>JavaFX</strong> − It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user interface API.</li>

				<p>Java is one of the most used programming languages for developing dynamic web applications. A web application is computer software that utilizes the web browser and technologies to perform tasks over the internet. A web application is deployed on a web server.<br><br>
				Java provides some technologies like Servlet and JSP that allow us to develop and deploy a web application on a server easily. It also provides some frameworks such as Spring, Spring Boot that simplify the work and provide an efficient way to develop a web application. They reduce the effort of the developer.<br><br>
				We can create a website using static HTML pages and style them using CSS, but we need server-side technology when we want to create a dynamic website.
