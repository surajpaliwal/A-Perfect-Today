				<p>MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high-volume data storage. It contains the data model, which allows you to represent hierarchical relationships.<br> It uses JSON-like documents with optional schema instead of using tables and rows in traditional relational databases. Documents containing key-value pairs are the basic units of data in MongoDB.

		  		The initial development of MongoDB began in 2007 when the company was building a platform as a service similar to window azure.<br><br>

				<strong>Window azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure, created by Microsoft, to build, deploy and manage applications and service through a global network.</strong><br><br>
				MongoDB was developed by a NewYork based organization named 10gen which is now known as MongoDB Inc. It was initially developed as a PAAS (Platform as a Service). Later in 2009, it is introduced in the market as an open source database server that was maintained and supported by MongoDB Inc<br><br>.

				The first ready production of MongoDB has been considered from version 1.4 which was released in March 2010.<br>

				MongoDB2.4.9 was the latest and stable version which was released on January 10, 2014.

		  		<p>It may be a very genuine question that - "what was the need of MongoDB although there were many databases in action?"<br>
				<strong>There is a simple answer:</strong><br>

				All the modern applications require big data, fast features development, flexible deployment, and the older database systems not competent enough, so the MongoDB was needed.<br><br>

					  	<strong>The primary purpose of building MongoDB is:</strong>

					  	<p>MongoDB is a document oriented database. It is a key feature of MongoDB. It offers a document oriented storage. It is very simple you can program it easily.<br><br>

						MongoDB stores data as documents, so it is known as document-oriented database.<br>
						For example:<br>
							FirstName = "John", <br>                                                                 Address = "Detroit",<br> 
							Spouse = [{Name: "Angela"}]. <br>
							FirstName ="John",    <br>
							Address = "Wick"  <br>
						</p>

		  		These are some important features of MongoDB:
		  		<ul>
		  			<li><strong>Support ad hoc queries:</strong>In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.</li>
					<li><strong>Indexing:</strong>You can index any field in a document.</li>
					<li><strong>Replication:</strong>MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.<br>A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)
					</li>					
					<li><strong>Duplication of data:</strong>MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.</li>
					<li><strong>Load balancing:</strong>It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.</li>
					<li>Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.</li>
					<li>Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.</li>
					<li>It is a schema-less database written in C++.</li>
					<li>Provides high performance.</li>
					<li>Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.</li>
					<li>Easy to administer in the case of failures.</li>
					<li>It also supports:
						<ul>
							<li>JSON data model with dynamic schemas</li>
							<li>Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability</li>
							<li>Built in replication for high availability</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
